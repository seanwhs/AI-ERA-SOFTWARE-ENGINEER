# **Song 1: “System Owner”**

*Theme:* The shift from coding to owning systems. Anthem-like, inspiring.

**Verse 1**
AI can write the lines,
It turns the hours into signs.
But when the code is cheap and fast,
Who stands to hold it all at last?

**Pre-Chorus**
It’s not the syntax that defines your worth,
It’s judgment, responsibility, and the system’s birth.

**Chorus**
From code producer to system owner,
You don’t just build, you make it stronger.
Reliability, security, the crown you wear,
In the AI era, only owners dare.

**Verse 2**
Boundaries drawn, failures foreseen,
Architectural trade-offs in between.
AI can help, but it cannot own,
The system lives because of flesh and bone.

**Bridge**
Incidents come, postmortems done,
You lead the fight, you don’t run.
Zero trust, least privilege, all in line,
Ownership is yours, the code is just a sign.

**Chorus**
From code producer to system owner,
You don’t just build, you make it stronger.
Reliability, security, the crown you wear,
In the AI era, only owners dare.

# **Song 2: “Zero Trust”**

*Theme:* Security as a mindset, almost like a cyberpunk-inspired cautionary anthem.

**Verse 1**
Never trust by default,
Every call, every vault.
Credentials leak, networks lie,
The breach is coming, can’t deny.

**Chorus**
Zero trust, build it in your bones,
Every boundary signed, every risk known.
Least privilege everywhere, verify again,
Contain the damage, learn from the pain.

**Verse 2**
AI writes a line, you check it twice,
Design for failure, not just dice.
Authentication, authorization, all aligned,
Security’s not a feature, it’s your state of mind.

**Bridge**
Continuous verification, explicit trust boundaries,
Failures are lessons, not anomalies.
The system survives because of your eyes,
A single mistake, and everything dies.

**Chorus**
Zero trust, build it in your bones,
Every boundary signed, every risk known.
Least privilege everywhere, verify again,
Contain the damage, learn from the pain.

# **Song 3: “ADR Anthem”**

*Theme:* Documenting decisions, leaving a trace in a fast AI world. Mid-tempo, thoughtful, almost folk-tech style.

**Verse 1**
What problem are we solving today?
Constraints in place, choices on display.
Alternatives weighed, trade-offs clear,
The future reads these words when we’re not here.

**Chorus**
ADR, tell the story true,
Decisions live on after me and you.
AI may build, but it cannot decide,
The system remembers where judgment resides.

**Verse 2**
Security implications, consequences shown,
AI’s hand in code, but human thought alone.
Context preserved, accountability stays,
In the log of tomorrow, your name will blaze.

**Bridge**
Status proposed, accepted, deprecated,
The path we chose, carefully documented.
Without the record, all is lost,
ADR is the compass, whatever the cost.

**Chorus**
ADR, tell the story true,
Decisions live on after me and you.
AI may build, but it cannot decide,
The system remembers where judgment resides.

# **Song 4: “The AI Era”**

*Theme:* Reality check—AI raises the floor, humans raise the ceiling. Energetic, almost hip-hop or electronic beat.

**Verse 1**
AI writes the code in the blink of an eye,
But the system still needs a mind nearby.
Fast and cheap, the lines appear,
But weak engineering? The ceiling’s clear.

**Chorus**
AI raises the floor, humans raise the ceiling,
Responsibility, judgment, that’s the real feeling.
You’re no longer a producer, you own the show,
System owner standing where the strong ones go.

**Verse 2**
Incidents, postmortems, lessons learned,
Every mistake, every bridge burned.
AI is a tool, not a savior,
Ownership is power, accountability is favor.

**Bridge**
Measure yourself, climb the ladder high,
From contributor to principal, touch the sky.
Trust, responsibility, relevance remains,
In the AI era, ownership sustains.

**Chorus**
AI raises the floor, humans raise the ceiling,
Responsibility, judgment, that’s the real feeling.
You’re no longer a producer, you own the show,
System owner standing where the strong ones go.
