# Bad Requirements Workshop — AI-Era Software Engineer

> **Purpose:** Simulate handling poorly defined or conflicting requirements to practice clarification, prioritization, and iterative delivery.

---

## Scenario Setup

* **System:** Full-stack application (Django backend, React frontend) with AI-assisted features.
* **Problem:** Stakeholders provide vague or contradictory requirements, e.g., AI summary feature must be "fast" and "always accurate" without defining limits.
* **Workshop Setting:** Team must clarify, prioritize, and plan incremental delivery.

---

## Objectives

1. **Requirement Clarification**

   * Engage stakeholders with structured questions.
   * Define acceptance criteria and measurable goals.
   * Identify constraints (performance, cost, AI limitations).

2. **Prioritization & Planning**

   * Break requirements into MVP features.
   * Decide what can be delivered first and what must be deferred.
   * Assign tasks to backend, frontend, and AI teams.

3. **Iterative Implementation**

   * Implement small, testable features.
   * Use feedback loops to adjust requirements and expectations.
   * Document assumptions and decisions made during implementation.

4. **Post-Workshop Retrospective**

   * Review how the team managed ambiguity.
   * Identify communication and decision-making improvements.
   * Update requirements templates and workshop guidelines.

| Role                        | Responsibilities                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Owner / Stakeholder | Provide context, answer questions, prioritize features           |
| Backend Engineer            | Estimate feasibility, implement MVP APIs                         |
| Frontend Engineer           | Build UI/UX based on iterative specs                             |
| AI Engineer                 | Clarify AI capabilities, test outputs against requirements       |
| Bridge Engineer             | Ensure alignment, facilitate communication, document assumptions |
| Team Lead / Facilitator     | Guide workshop, resolve conflicts, enforce process               |

## Key Takeaways

* Ambiguity is normal; the goal is to **clarify, prioritize, and iterate**.
* Bridge Engineers play a critical role in aligning stakeholders, AI capabilities, and system constraints.
* Structured workshops and documented decisions prevent miscommunication and rework.
* Continuous feedback loops increase delivery quality and reduce risk.
