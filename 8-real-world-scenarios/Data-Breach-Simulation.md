# Data Breach Simulation — AI-Era Software Engineer

> **Purpose:** Train engineers to respond to a simulated data breach, focusing on incident response, mitigation, and postmortem analysis.

---

## Scenario Setup

* **System:** Full-stack app with Django backend, React frontend, AI integration.
* **Breach Simulation:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data detected via monitoring system.
* **Alerting:** Security team triggered, high-severity incident.

---

## Objectives

1. **Immediate Response**

   * Contain breach: revoke access, isolate affected systems.
   * Disable compromised accounts and reset credentials.
   * Enable audit logs to track breach scope.

2. **Investigation**

   * Determine entry point (API, frontend, AI integration).
   * Analyze logs, AI output, and network activity.
   * Evaluate data exposure and regulatory impact.

3. **Mitigation & Recovery**

   * Patch vulnerabilities, apply security fixes.
   * Restore system integrity, monitor for recurring anomalies.
   * Notify stakeholders and comply with legal requirements.

4. **Postmortem & Process Improvement**

   * Document timeline, root cause, and mitigation steps.
   * Update security policies, access controls, and monitoring.
   * Train team based on lessons learned.
