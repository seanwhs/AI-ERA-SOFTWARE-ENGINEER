# 🛠️ **Weekly Self-Audit — Bridge Engineer**

> **Purpose**: Maintain engineering sharpness in an AI-accelerated environment.
>
> This is not a productivity tracker. It is a **judgment and ownership audit**.

> **Complete this once per week. Be brutally honest.**

This template encourages **honest reflection** on both technical and non-technical aspects of your work. It highlights areas for improvement, reinforces strong habits, and forces deep self-assessment on **key engineering principles**.
