# 🎯 Scoring Guide

This guide converts qualitative behavior into **actionable readiness signals**.

---

## Scoring Method

For each dimension, score yourself:

* **1** — Foundational
* **2** — Functional
* **3** — Bridge Engineer
* **4** — Senior / Architect

Maximum score: **24**

---

## Interpretation

| Score Range | Meaning                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **6–10**    | Syntax‑focused developer                 |
| **11–15**   | Functional but requires supervision      |
| **16–20**   | **Bridge Engineer — production capable** |
| **21–24**   | Senior / Architect trajectory            |

---

## Usage Notes

* Do not self‑inflate scores
* Require concrete evidence
* Re‑score quarterly

Progress is measured by **reduced uncertainty**, not speed.

## Final Reminder

> Titles do not determine readiness.
> Behavior under pressure does.
