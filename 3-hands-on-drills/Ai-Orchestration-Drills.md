## Drill 1: AI as Junior Assistant

**Checklist Mapped:** AI code review, prompt engineering

* Choose a trivial backend or frontend feature.
* Generate a first draft using AI (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Windsurf).
* Audit every line for correctness, security, and compliance with contracts.
* Refactor and document changes.

**Deliverable:** Annotated AI output + corrected production-ready version

---

## Drill 2: Prompt Engineering for Accuracy

**Checklist Mapped:** AI orchestration, context engineering

* Provide AI a feature spec without implementation.
* Write progressively refined prompts.
* Compare outputs and identify which prompt yields the most accurate, safe, and maintainable code.

**Deliverable:** Prompt log + chosen prompt + AI output + audit notes

---

## Drill 3: AI-Generated Tests

**Checklist Mapped:** Testing & AI integration

* Ask AI to generate unit or integration tests for an existing module.
* Review tests for completeness and edge case coverage.
* Run tests and verify they catch intentional failures.

**Deliverable:** Verified AI-generated test suite + audit notes

---

## Drill 4: AI Failure Simulation

**Checklist Mapped:** Failure thinking, AI risk

* Introduce intentional errors or unexpected inputs.
* Observe how AI-generated code handles them.
* Adjust prompts or code to handle edge cases safely.

**Deliverable:** Demo showing AI error handling + lessons learned

---

## Drill 5: AI in Full-Stack Workflow

**Checklist Mapped:** Integration, bridge logic

* Implement a feature where AI processes frontend input via backend (e.g., text summarization or code formatting).
* Validate AI output before returning to UI.
* Test the full flow for edge cases, latency, and partial failure.

**Deliverable:** Working feature + integration test + AI review checklist

---

## Drill 6: Ethical & Security Considerations

**Checklist Mapped:** Security, organizational responsibility

* Review AI output for potential sensitive data leakage.
* Document ethical considerations (bias, hallucinations, misuse).
* Apply necessary guardrails in code and deployment.

**Deliverable:** Security & ethics audit doc + code safeguards
