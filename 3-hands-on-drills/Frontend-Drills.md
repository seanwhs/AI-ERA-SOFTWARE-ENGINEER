# Frontend Hands-On Drills — AI-Era Bridge Engineer

> **Purpose:** Convert checklist items into actionable frontend exercises that build Bridge Engineer capabilities.

---

## Drill 1: TypeScript Contract Enforcement

**Checklist Mapped:** Type safety, backend contract alignment

* Take a backend API (Django REST Framework).
* Define TypeScript interfaces/types for request and response.
* Connect a React frontend component.
* Ensure type errors appear when the contract changes.

**Deliverable:** Fully typed component + interface mismatch report

---

## Drill 2: State Management & Effects

**Checklist Mapped:** Local/global state, predictable behavior

* Implement a data-fetching component using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
* Add a global state slice with Context or Zustand.
* Introduce simulated API latency and failure.
* Ensure proper error handling and consistent UI state.

**Deliverable:** Functional component demonstrating correct state transitions

---

## Drill 3: TanStack Query / React Query Integration

**Checklist Mapped:** Data fetching, caching, error recovery

* Fetch data from a backend API.
* Implement caching, background refresh, and error retries.
* Add UI states for loading, error, and empty data.

**Deliverable:** Component with robust async data handling

---

## Drill 4: Component Reusability & Composition

**Checklist Mapped:** Functional components, props validation

* Refactor a large component into smaller reusable units.
* Use TypeScript to enforce prop types.
* Ensure all units remain fully functional.

**Deliverable:** Refactored component tree + documentation

---

## Drill 5: Styling with Tailwind CSS

**Checklist Mapped:** Production-ready UI, speed, consistency

* Recreate a page from a design spec using Tailwind.
* Ensure responsiveness and accessibility.
* Demonstrate a theme or color variation using Tailwind utilities.

**Deliverable:** Responsive, accessible, production-ready page

---

## Drill 6: Frontend Error Simulation

**Checklist Mapped:** Failure thinking, bridge logic

* Simulate API errors or invalid data.
* Observe component behavior.
* Add proper fallback states, alerts, or logging.

**Deliverable:** Component demonstrating graceful degradation

---

## Drill 7: AI-Generated Frontend Code Review

**Checklist Mapped:** AI orchestration, audit, system integration

* Generate a React component via AI.
* Audit for logic errors, type mismatches, missing error handling.
* Refactor to match system and API contracts.

**Deliverable:** Annotated AI-generated code + corrected production-ready component
