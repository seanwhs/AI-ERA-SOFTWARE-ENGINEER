# 🖥️ Frontend Hands-On Drills — AI-Era Bridge Engineer

> **Purpose:** Convert checklist items into **actionable frontend exercises** that develop Bridge Engineer capabilities.
> Focus on **typed, resilient, and production-ready UI** that integrates seamlessly with backend systems and AI outputs.

---

## Drill 1: TypeScript Contract Enforcement

**Competency Mapping:** Type safety, backend contract alignment

**Steps:**

1. Take a backend API (Django REST Framework).
2. Define **TypeScript interfaces/types** for request and response.
3. Connect a React frontend component.
4. Ensure **type errors appear** when the backend contract changes.

**Deliverable:** Fully typed component + interface mismatch report

---

## Drill 2: State Management & Effects

**Competency Mapping:** Local/global state, predictable behavior

**Steps:**

1. Implement a data-fetching component using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
2. Add a **global state slice** with Context or Zustand.
3. Introduce **simulated API latency and failure**.
4. Ensure proper **error handling** and consistent **UI state**.

**Deliverable:** Functional component demonstrating correct state transitions

---

## Drill 3: TanStack Query / React Query Integration

**Competency Mapping:** Data fetching, caching, error recovery

**Steps:**

1. Fetch data from a backend API.
2. Implement **caching, background refresh, and retry logic**.
3. Add UI states for **loading, error, and empty data**.

**Deliverable:** Component with robust async data handling

---

## Drill 4: Component Reusability & Composition

**Competency Mapping:** Functional components, props validation

**Steps:**

1. Refactor a large component into **smaller reusable units**.
2. Use TypeScript to enforce **prop types**.
3. Ensure all units **remain fully functional**.

**Deliverable:** Refactored component tree + documentation

---

## Drill 5: Styling with Tailwind CSS

**Competency Mapping:** Production-ready UI, speed, consistency

**Steps:**

1. Recreate a page from a **design spec** using Tailwind.
2. Ensure **responsiveness and accessibility**.
3. Demonstrate a **theme or color variation** using Tailwind utilities.

**Deliverable:** Responsive, accessible, production-ready page

---

## Drill 6: Frontend Error Simulation

**Competency Mapping:** Failure thinking, bridge logic

**Steps:**

1. Simulate **API errors or invalid data**.
2. Observe **component behavior**.
3. Add proper **fallback states, alerts, or logging**.

**Deliverable:** Component demonstrating graceful degradation

---

## Drill 7: AI-Generated Frontend Code Review

**Competency Mapping:** AI orchestration, audit, system integration

**Steps:**

1. Generate a React component via AI.
2. Audit **logic errors, type mismatches, and missing error handling**.
3. Refactor to **match system and API contracts**.

**Deliverable:** Annotated AI-generated code + corrected production-ready component

---

> Completing these drills builds **predictable, typed, and resilient frontends** capable of bridging with backend systems and AI outputs.
> Each drill should be **scored against the checklist** and discussed in **weekly or monthly self-audits**.
