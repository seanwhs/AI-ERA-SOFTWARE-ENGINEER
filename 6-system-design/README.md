# System Design in the AI Era

System design is the discipline of defining **how a system works as a whole** —
not just how individual functions are implemented.

In the AI era, system design is a primary human responsibility.

## What System Design Includes

### 1. Functional Structure
- What components exist?
- What responsibilities does each component own?

### 2. Interactions
- How components communicate
- APIs, events, and data contracts

### 3. Quality Attributes
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Security

### 4. Trade-Offs
- Cost vs scalability
- Simplicity vs flexibility
- Speed vs safety

## Typical Outputs
- Architecture diagrams
- API specifications
- Data flow diagrams
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

AI can help generate code.  
Humans must decide **what should exist and why**.
