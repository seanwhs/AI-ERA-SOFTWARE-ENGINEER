# 🖥 Cybersecurity Desktop Exercise — Scenario Scripts & Red-Herring Triggers

## Scenario 1: Phishing Attack

* Send simulated malicious emails to test accounts
* Include clickable links in sandbox environment
* Red-Herring: benign spam emails to distract teams

## Scenario 2: Ransomware Simulation

* Simulate file encryption on endpoint with AV alerts
* Red-Herring: background CPU spike from non-malicious process

## Scenario 3: Privilege Escalation

* Generate fake sudo/root attempt logs
* Red-Herring: Admin maintenance scripts with high login activity

## Scenario 4: Data Exfiltration

* Simulate large file transfer to external IP
* Red-Herring: legitimate backup process generating similar traffic

## Notes for Facilitators

* Trigger red-herrings intermittently to test team focus
* Track detection time, AI assistance usage, and decision accuracy
* Rotate scenarios to increase difficulty for senior teams
