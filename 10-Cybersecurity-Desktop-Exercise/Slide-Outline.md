### **Slide 5 — Key Reminders for the Exercise**

* **Human-First Approach:**

  * Always validate AI suggestions with human expertise.
  * Focus on root cause analysis, not just symptoms.
  * Think critically—question assumptions.

* **AI-Assisted Tools:**

  * Use AI to speed up the analysis but not to replace investigation.
  * Ensure all AI suggestions are cross-checked before taking action.

* **Red Herrings:**

  * Be aware of distractions and false positives.
  * Focus on core symptoms and validate alerts carefully.

* **Documentation:**

  * Keep track of decisions, timing, and action items.
  * Use the post-incident review to refine processes and improve efficiency.

### **Slide 6 — Human-First Detection Process**

1. **Initial Detection:**

   * Look for unusual behavior in logs, traffic, and systems.
   * Cross-reference with baseline metrics.

2. **Validate Alerts:**

   * Don’t assume that alerts are always accurate.
   * Check for false positives and verify anomalies.

3. **Incident Classification:**

   * Identify if it’s a potential high-priority threat or a benign event.
   * Categorize threats using common models (e.g., STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK).

4. **Collaborative Analysis:**

   * Share findings with your team.
   * Collaborate to refine the investigation.

---

### **Slide 7 — AI-Assisted Remediation Process**

1. **AI Alert Review:**

   * Evaluate the AI suggestion based on historical data and patterns.
2. **AI Prompt Validation:**

   * Cross-check AI-generated solutions with known procedures or expert judgment.
3. **Deployment:**

   * If confirmed, implement the AI-recommended solution while closely monitoring.
4. **Post-Action Monitoring:**

   * After applying remediation, monitor system performance and user behavior for any new indicators.

---

### **Slide 8 — Preparing for Post-Exercise Review**

* **Incident Reporting:**

  * Capture lessons learned.
  * Document your response time, effectiveness, and post-event actions.

* **Metrics Review:**

  * Track success based on predefined KPIs: response times, accuracy of AI predictions, handling of red herrings, etc.

* **Continuous Improvement:**

  * After the exercise, update your playbooks, incident runbooks, and detection strategies based on the findings.

---

### **Slide 9 — Wrap-Up & Final Thoughts**

* **Key Takeaways:**

  * Cybersecurity is a collaborative effort—AI and human expertise working together is critical.
  * Red herrings can test your ability to stay focused, but critical thinking and analysis are your best tools.
  * Post-incident analysis and metrics are crucial to improve response for future threats.

* **Next Steps:**

  * Review the exercise findings, refine the security strategy, and schedule follow-up drills.
