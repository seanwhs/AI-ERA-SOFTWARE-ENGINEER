# Safe AI Usage Guidelines — AI-Era Software Engineer

> **Purpose:** Establish safe and responsible practices for using AI tools in software engineering.

---

## 1. Treat AI as Assistive, Not Authoritative

* AI suggestions are **drafts**, not final code.
* Always verify outputs against business rules, system constraints, and security policies.

---

## 2. Input & Output Validation

* Never trust AI-generated input blindly.
* Validate AI outputs rigorously, especially for security, data integrity, and compliance.
* Sanitize data to prevent injection or unexpected behavior.

---

## 3. Ethical & Legal Compliance

* Do not use AI outputs that infringe on intellectual property.
* Ensure privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA) are respected.
* Avoid AI-generated content that could be biased or harmful.

---

## 4. Logging & Auditing

* Record AI prompts, outputs, and decisions made based on them.
* Maintain a clear audit trail for accountability.
* Document modifications applied to AI-generated code.

---

## 5. Collaboration & Review

* Peer-review AI outputs before integration.
* Encourage team discussions on AI-assisted decisions.
* Train juniors on AI best practices and pitfalls.

---

## 6. System-Level Precautions

* Limit AI API rate usage to avoid system overload.
* Implement fallbacks for AI failures or latency issues.
* Isolate AI processing from critical production flows where possible.

---

## 7. Continuous Learning

* Regularly update prompts and review patterns to improve reliability.
* Share lessons learned across the team.
* Evaluate new AI tools critically before adoption.
