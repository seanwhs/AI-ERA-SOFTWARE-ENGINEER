# AI as Intern — AI-Era Software Engineer

> **Purpose:** Guide engineers on using AI as a productivity assistant, not a replacement, while maintaining ownership and code quality.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy

* AI can handle **repetitive, boilerplate, or research-heavy tasks**.
* Humans retain **responsibility for correctness, security, and business context**.
* Treat AI output as a **draft** requiring review.

## 2. Practical Usage

| Task                | AI Role                            | Human Role                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Code Snippets       | Suggest patterns or boilerplate    | Review, integrate, and test         |
| Documentation       | Draft comments or READMEs          | Edit for accuracy and clarity       |
| Refactoring         | Suggest code improvements          | Approve changes and validate impact |
| Learning / Research | Summarize docs, APIs, or libraries | Validate findings and apply context |

## 3. Workflow

1. **Prompt Clearly:** Give AI context and constraints.
2. **Review Thoroughly:** Check for logic, security, and edge cases.
3. **Integrate Carefully:** Add AI output incrementally.
4. **Test Extensively:** Unit, integration, and AI-specific validations.
5. **Document Decisions:** Note why AI output was accepted or modified.

## 4. Pitfalls to Avoid

* Blindly copying AI code.
* Ignoring AI hallucinations or unsafe suggestions.
* Over-relying on AI for design or architecture decisions.
* Forgetting to audit and test thoroughly.

---

## 5. Key Takeaways

* AI is **your intern, not your co-pilot**.
* Human judgment, ownership, and responsibility remain paramount.
* Use AI to **amplify productivity**, not to replace critical thinking.
* Document and audit all AI contributions to maintain system integrity.
