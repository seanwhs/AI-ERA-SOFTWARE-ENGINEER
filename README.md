# 🧠 AI‑Era Software Engineer

## From Typist to System Owner (2026+)

> AI can generate code.
> Engineers own systems.

This repository is a **professional, production‑oriented playbook** for engineers navigating the AI era.

It is designed for:

* Individual engineers upgrading from syntax → systems thinking
* Teams standardizing expectations and leveling
* Hiring managers assessing *real* engineering readiness

This is **not** a tutorial repo.
This is a **read‑world readiness framework**.

## 🧭 What Is an AI‑Era Software Engineer?

An AI‑Era Software Engineer:

* Owns systems end‑to‑end
* Treats AI as an **intern**, not an authority
* Understands contracts, failure modes, and trade‑offs
* Can debug calmly at **3 a.m.**

In 2026+, this engineer is no longer optional.
