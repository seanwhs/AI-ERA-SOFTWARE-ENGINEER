# 🧱 Bridge Engineer 2026  
### From Typist to Architect in the AI Era

> AI can write code.  
> Engineers own systems.

This repository is a **practical, production-oriented playbook** for becoming a **Bridge Engineer**—the engineer who connects backend logic, frontend interfaces, AI tooling, and real-world constraints into a system that actually works.

This is not a tutorial repo.  
This is a **readiness framework**.

## 🧭 What Is a Bridge Engineer?

A Bridge Engineer:
- Owns **end-to-end systems**
- Treats AI as an **intern**, not an authority
- Understands **contracts, failure modes, and trade-offs**
- Can debug a system at **3 a.m. without panic**

In 2026, this is the engineer companies need.
