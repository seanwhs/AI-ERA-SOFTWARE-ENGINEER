## Notes for Interviewer

* Candidates should demonstrate **ownership of end-to-end flows**, not just coding ability.
* Evaluate ability to **integrate AI responsibly** and handle system-level trade-offs.
* Include exercises that involve both **frontend + backend + AI orchestration**.
* Ask for examples of past failures and how they mitigated them.
