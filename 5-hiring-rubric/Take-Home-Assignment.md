# Take-Home Assignment — AI-Era Software Engineer

> **Purpose:** Evaluate candidate's ability to design, implement, and document a real-world feature integrating frontend, backend, and optionally AI.

---

## Assignment Overview

**Goal:** Build a small full-stack application with a focus on system ownership, integration, and AI usage.

**Timeframe:** 1 week (self-paced)

**Allowed Tools:** Django + DRF backend, React + TypeScript frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling. AI tools may be used **for guidance or drafting only**, not as final submission.

---

## Requirements

### Backend

* Implement a REST API for managing a resource (e.g., articles, books, tasks).
* Include endpoints: list, retrieve, create, update, delete.
* Implement JWT authentication and role-based permissions.
* Add input validation and error handling.

### Frontend

* Build a React + TypeScript UI to consume your API.
* Implement state management and async data handling.
* Handle loading, error, and empty states gracefully.
* Use Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.

### AI Integration (Optional but Recommended)

* Add a feature that uses AI (e.g., text summarization, sentiment analysis).
* Ensure AI output is validated before rendering in UI.
* Document AI prompts and review process.

### Testing & Documentation

* Write unit and integration tests.
* Provide documentation for setup, API endpoints, and any AI-related design decisions.
* Include a README explaining how to run the project and test features.
