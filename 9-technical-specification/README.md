# Technical Specifications

Technical specifications translate architecture into precise, enforceable constraints.

They are essential when working with AI-generated code.

## What a Good Specification Includes

- Interfaces and contracts
- Data schemas
- Error handling behavior
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Versioning and compatibility rules

## Why Specs Matter in the AI Era

AI systems follow instructions literally.
Vague specifications lead to:
- Incorrect behavior
- Security gaps
- Operational risk

Clear specs allow engineers to:
- Constrain AI output
- Verify correctness
- Maintain system integrity
